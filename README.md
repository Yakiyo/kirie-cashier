# Cash Register

**Kirie#3594**'s cashier project written in Rust. I only made this as a simple project to practice Rust as opposed to the original project being written in C.

Question for the project can be found in the [**ques**](./ques/) directory. The compiled binary of the project can be found in the [release section](https://github.com/Yakiyo/kirie-cashier/releases/latest).
