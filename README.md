# Cash Register

**Kirie#3594**'s cashier project written in Rust. I only made this as a simple project to practice Rust as opposed to the original project being written in C.

Question for the project can be found in the [**ques**](./ques/) directory. The compiled binary of the project can be found in the [release section](https://github.com/Yakiyo/kirie-cashier/releases/latest).

The solution of the project in C can also be found in the [C](./C) directory. The code was written by [`Look#0170`](https://github.com/Muril-o) and Kirie. IDK enough C to write anything myself
